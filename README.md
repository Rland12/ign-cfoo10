Front-End application for IGN Code Foo program

# Introduction
Hi, my name is Rashad. I am a 23 year old student with a passion for technology, games, and art. I have been a long-time subscriber and fan of IGN for years, 
so when I learned that I could work and learn from the developers there, I was ecstatic! As a programmer, I seek to learn new technologies in my free time and ways to inject my own personality into projects. 
This would be an excellent opportunity for me to put what I've learned into practice while also making valuable connections and obtaining 
insight into a professional career in technology. If I am accepted into the program, I hope to leave with the confidence and skills necessary to 
shine in my future efforts while also expanding my creative ability to aid others.

1) Record the number of houses and facilities in Jubilife Village.

3) Use a device to measure the amount of electricity a Voltorb can produce.
4) Calculate how many buildings can be powered by 1 Voltorb to test.
5) Divide the total number of buildings by the amount of Voltorb powered buildings.
6) Catch the amount of Voltorbs needed to power the whole village.
