Front-End application for IGN Code Foo program

# Introduction
Hi, my name is Rashad. I am a 23 year old student with a passion for technology, games, and art. I have been a long-time subscriber and fan of IGN for years, 
so when I learned that I could work and learn from the developers there, I was ecstatic! As a programmer, I seek to learn new technologies in my free time and ways to inject my own personality into projects. 
This would be an excellent opportunity for me to put what I've learned into practice while also making valuable connections and obtaining 
insight into a professional career in technology. If I am accepted into the program, I hope to leave with the confidence and skills necessary to 
shine in my future efforts while also expanding my creative ability to aid others.

# Hisui's New Power Plant

1) Record the number of houses and facilities in Jubilife Village.
2) Create a formula to measure the average amount of power each building needs to run.
3) Use a device to measure the amount of electricity a Voltorb can produce.
4) Calculate how many buildings can be powered by 1 Voltorb to test.
5) Divide the total number of buildings by the number of Voltorb-powered buildings.
6) Based on the number you got from step 5, you need to catch the number of Voltorbs needed to power the whole village.

# Front End Problem
1) gain access to demo server:https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo
2) download project and add the index to your browser.

# Final Thoughts
This was definitely a challenging project for sure. It helped me stretch my comfort zone when learning about fetching apis. The CORS part was tough to get around but thanks to the cors anywhere link it helped me bypass the issues with getting a response! That was a real life saver. Even though I didn't get the project quite right I still had fun working on it and will definitely improve upon it. The responses work for the most part but with some good dom manipulation it will serve its intended purpose.
